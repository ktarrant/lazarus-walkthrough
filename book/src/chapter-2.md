### Pokemon Spotlight: Eevee
Eevee is a Pokemon with many possibilities.
But an extra twist in this game is that if you can find one with the hidden
ability Anticipation, then you can evolve it into a Vaporeon to get access
to the hidden ability Piscivore. Piscivore gives you advantages with fishing.
