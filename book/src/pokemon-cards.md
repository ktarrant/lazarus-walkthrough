# Pokémon Cards

The walkthrough can now include autogenerated “Pokémon cards” that summarize a
species using localized data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Each card is
rendered by the Rust helper binary so whenever the source data changes we can
regenerate the Markdown snippet without touching the content manually.

## 1. Download the dataset once

```sh
mkdir -p data
curl -L https://github.com/PokeAPI/api-data/archive/refs/heads/master.zip \
  -o data/pokeapi-api-data.zip
unzip -q data/pokeapi-api-data.zip -d data
```

This keeps the entire dataset under `data/api-data-master`, which is ignored by
git so the repository stays light.

## 2. Generate a card

```sh
cargo run -- pokemon-card sprigatito > book/src/pokemon/sprigatito.md
```

Replace `sprigatito` with either a National Dex number or any canonical Pokémon
name. Use `POKEAPI_DATA_DIR=/custom/path cargo run -- pokemon-card popplio` if the
dataset lives somewhere else on your machine.

## 3. Reference the card in the book

Each generated file is a standalone Markdown fragment, so just link to the page
in `SUMMARY.md` or embed its contents inside another chapter.

To embed the card inline within a walkthrough chapter, use mdBook’s include
directive:

```
{{#include ./pokemon/bulbasaur.md}}
```

When `mdbook build` runs, the include expands to the rendered card exactly where
you placed it in the narrative.

For Pokémon Lazarus specifically, repeat the generation step for whichever
starter you pick in Acrisia City (Popplio, Rowlet, Froakie, Chespin, Litten,
Quaxly, Fennekin, Sprigatito, or Fuecoco) so the Chapter 1 walkthrough can pull
in the matching data-driven card.
