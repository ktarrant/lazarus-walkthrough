# Pokémon Cards

The walkthrough can now include autogenerated “Pokémon cards” that summarize a
species using localized data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Each card is
rendered by the Rust helper binary so whenever the source data changes we can
regenerate the Markdown snippet without touching the content manually.

## 1. Download the dataset once

```sh
mkdir -p data
curl -L https://github.com/PokeAPI/api-data/archive/refs/heads/master.zip \
  -o data/pokeapi-api-data.zip
unzip -q data/pokeapi-api-data.zip -d data
```

This keeps the entire dataset under `data/api-data-master`, which is ignored by
git so the repository stays light.

## 2. Generate a card

```sh
cargo run -- pokemon-card bulbasaur > book/src/pokemon/bulbasaur.md
```

Replace `bulbasaur` with either a National Dex number or any canonical Pokémon
name. Use `POKEAPI_DATA_DIR=/custom/path cargo run -- pokemon-card eevee` if the
dataset lives somewhere else on your machine.

## 3. Reference the card in the book

Each generated file is a standalone Markdown fragment, so just link to the page
in `SUMMARY.md` or embed its contents inside another chapter.
