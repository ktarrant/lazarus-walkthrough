# Important Game Tips

- **Name Rater**: Old man in Pythios Town home.
- **Move Relearner**: South Pythios Town; unlock after catching 20 Pokémon. Also teaches various tutor-exclusive moves.
- **Fishing**: Stardew-style minigame with treasure. Better rods increase bar size and have unique tables. Helpful abilities:
  - Piscivore (Vaporeon): much faster fishing
  - Sticky Hold / Suction Cups: slower fish movement
  - Illuminate: more treasure
  - Sturdy / Solid Rock / Rock Head: less bobber bounce
- **Farming held items**: Shards, Heart Scales, Leftovers, etc. All Meowth forms and Murkrow learn Thief ~Lv 20. Sofos City quest grants Glimmering Charm (boosts held-item odds).
- **Mega Evolution**: Complete Niko’s quest around Sofos City (Gym 4). Niko then sells Mega Stones in Acrisia University; inventory grows as you beat Gyms.
- **University Students**: One researcher per wild area; fill local dex to claim rewards (see University Student Rewards).
