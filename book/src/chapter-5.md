# Wanderer's Woods

## Back to Acrisia City
Once you beat the gym, go back to visit the Prof.
He will give you HM06 Rock Smash and the DexNav.
You can use Rock Smash to finally get that item at the middle of Acrisia City.

## Through Jusmail Town
Head south to Bronze Fields.
There's also an item blocked by smashable rocks to get in Bronze Fields.
Then in Jusmail Town, head through the south exit that is blocked by smashable rocks.

## Wanderer's Woods

On your way through the woods, you will have another run-in with Team Chimera.
