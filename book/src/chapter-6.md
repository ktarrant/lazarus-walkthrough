# Chapter 6 - Pythios Town

## Pythios Town
Pythios Town is home to the third gym.
The gym leader specializes in Ghost and Psychic type Pokemon.
Don't do the gym until you have cleared the Pythios Cemetery, which is to the west.
The man in the hat near the gym will give you Will-o-Wisp.
The woman with the spider will sell you an outfit.
On the beach in the south, a Move Relearner is available if you have 20 Pokemon registered.
