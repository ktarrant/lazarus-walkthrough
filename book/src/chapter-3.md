# Acrisia Mountains & Riverwalk Trail

## Backtrack to Acrisia Mountains
We are going to backtrack to Acrisia City, and then go west to the Acrisia Mountains.
This area was blocked previously.

Once inside the cave, you will need to solve two tile puzzles to meet with the Elder.

### Pokemon Spotlight: Mawile
I have a soft spot for Mawile because it has so many resistances, and because it just
looks super weird but in a cute way.
But I'm not sure it is actually that good.
Try to prioritize Defense or Special Defense at the expense of Speed.

### Encounters

**University Student Reward (Acrisia Mountains):** 15 Moon Balls.

## Acrisia Mountains Peak
Once you meet the Elder, he will give you Espathra, a mount you can summon with a whistle.
There are also a few interesting Pokemon you can catch on the peak.

### Pokémon Spotlight: Bronzor
Bronzor is a sturdy Steel/Psychic wall that shrugs off many early threats. With great resistances and access to moves like Confuse Ray and Hypnosis, it can stall while your team sets up. Evolving into Bronzong brings Levitate/Heatproof utility and excellent bulk for midgame bosses.

## Riverwalk Trail
Now that you have finished the mountain, we move onto the Riverwalk Trail
which will take us to the next city.
To get on the trail you walk along the tracks that start on the edge of the mountains.

### Pokémon Spotlight
- **Gligar** — Ground/Flying pivot with Immunity (poison immunity) and an excellent typing for the Electric/Grass threats ahead. Learns strong STABs and utility like Knock Off and U-turn; later evolves into Gliscor for top-tier bulk and recovery.

- **Dreepy** — Fast Dragon/Ghost opener that evolves into Drakloak/Dragapult. Early on it leans on speed and support, but the final form is a premier special attacker with wide coverage, rewarding early investment.
