# Acrisia Mountains & Riverwalk Trail

## Backtrack to Acrisia Mountains
We are going to backtrack to Acrisia City, and then go west to the Acrisia Mountains.
This area was blocked previously.

Once inside the cave, you will need to solve two tile puzzles to meet with the Elder.

## Acrisia Mountains Peak
Once you meet the Elder, he will give you Espathra, a mount you can summon with a whistle.
There are also a few interesting Pokemon you can catch on the peak.

## Riverwalk Trail
Now that you have finished the mountain, we move onto the Riverwalk Trail
which will take us to the next city.
To get on the trail you walk along the tracks that start on the edge of the mountains.
