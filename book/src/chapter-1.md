# Acrisia City

## Acrisia City & Bronze Fields

You begin in Acrisia City, awakened by the Professor’s urgent call for a new
Pokédex initiative across the Lazarus region.

Inside the annex you’ll choose one of nine Lazarus starters:

- Popplio
- Rowlet
- Froakie
- Chespin
- Litten
- Quaxly
- Fennekin
- Sprigatito
- Fuecoco

Next, stock up on Pokeballs at the PokeMart.
I like to catch new Pokemon whenever they come up.
The road between Acrisia City and Jusmail Town is all the way on the left
and down.

## Bronze Fields
Catch Pokemon and fight trainers on this path.
On the way, you will find the delivery man being attacked and help him.
Once you win, you can bring the package back to the Prof.
When you have returned the package, you can continue south to Jusmail Town.
