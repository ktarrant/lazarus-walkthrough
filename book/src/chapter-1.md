# Acrisia City & Bronze Fields

## Acrisia City

You begin in Acrisia City, awakened by the Professor’s urgent call for a new
Pokédex initiative across the Lazarus region.

Inside the annex you’ll choose one of nine Lazarus starters:

{{#include ./pokemon/popplio.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/rowlet.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/froakie.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/chespin.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/litten.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/quaxly.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/fennekin.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/sprigatito.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/fuecoco.md}}

Next, stock up on Pokeballs at the PokeMart.
I like to catch new Pokemon whenever they come up.
The road between Acrisia City and Jusmail Town is all the way on the left
and down.

### Pokemon Spotlight: Munna
Munna is a great Pokemon to use for catching other Pokemon.
The ability Synchronize will make it so wild Pokemon will have the same nature as your Munna.
So for example if you can find a Jolly Munna, then when the Munna is at the head of your
party, wild Pokemon that are encountered will also have the Jolly ability.
Also, Munna learns Yawn at level 7 and Hypnosis at level 19.
Sleep offers the highest catch rate increase of all status effects.

### Pokemon Spotlight: Comfey
Comfey does not evolve, but can provide some surprisingly good early game value.
Comfey is fast and has decent defense, and learns multiple moves to heal itself.

### Pokemon Spotlight: Ducklett
Ducklett can play the role of the classic early game flying Pokemon.
If you can get one with Drizzle ability, it may even be worth keeping.
