# Chapter 1 – Acrisia City to Jusmail Town

You begin in Acrisia City, awakened by the Professor’s urgent call for a new
Pokédex initiative across the Lazarus region. After collecting the Rotom Phone,
Trainer ID, and Running Shoes from your guardian, explore the city square for
optional NPC hints about the hack’s custom mechanics. When you’re ready, head
southwest toward the research annex—the route doubles as the tutorial zone, so
keep the generated `type-chart` handy if you need a refresher on
super-effective matchups.

Inside the annex you’ll choose one of nine Lazarus starters:

- Popplio
- Rowlet
- Froakie
- Chespin
- Litten
- Quaxly
- Fennekin
- Sprigatito
- Fuecoco

Each option gets equal attention in this walkthrough—generate the card for
whichever partner you selected and include it directly in this chapter. The
cards below showcase every starter available in the Acrisia lab.

{{#include ./pokemon/quaxly.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/fennekin.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/sprigatito.md}}

{{#include ./pokemon/fuecoco.md}}

Once your partner is registered, stock up on Potions and Antidotes from the
pop-up kiosk beside the annex. The road between Acrisia City and Jusmail Town
is packed with Bug Catchers and status-spamming hikers, so bring Flying or Fire
coverage if possible (or plan extra antidotes when choosing Popplio/Froakie).
The moment you cross the stained-glass archway you’ll enter Jusmail proper—heal
at the Pokémon Center, grab the regional map from the Tourist NPC, and prepare
for the scripted rival encounter near the fountain.
