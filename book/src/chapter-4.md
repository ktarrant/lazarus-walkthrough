# Kalami City

## Kalami City
- Kalami City is home to the second gym, which is Rock, Steel, and Electric types.
Winning allows you to use HM06 Rock Smash outside of battle.
- You can find a fisherman on the east side of the map who will give you an Old Rod.
- A man in one of the houses will give you a quest to complete the Eevee Pokedex entry.
- A fisherman on the east side of town will give you an Old Rod.

### Specialty Pokeballs
The PokeMart in this town sells speciality Pokeballs.
- Level Ball can get up to a very high multiplier, but is less useful because
lower level Pokemon are already easier to catch.
- Quick Ball offers a 4x catchrate on the first turn. Only use on first turn.
- Timer Ball offers a 4x catchrate after 10 turns.
- Lure Ball offers a 4x catchrate when fishing.
- Repeat Ball offers a 3x catchrate on Pokemon caught before,
which is good for nature/IV hunting.

These are my favorites.
Compare to the 2x catchrate of an Ultra Ball.
