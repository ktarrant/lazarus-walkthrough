# Kalami City

## Kalami City
Kalami City is home to the second gym, which is Rock, Steel, and Electric types.
Winning allows you to use HM06 Rock Smash outside of battle.
You can find a fisherman on the east side of the map who will give you an Old Rod.
A man in one of the houses will give you a quest to complete the Eevee Pokedex entry.
A fisherman on the east side of town will give you an Old Rod.
The PokeMart in this town sells speciality Pokeballs.
The Level Ball can get up to a very high multiplier, but is less useful because
lower level Pokemon are already easier to catch.
The Quick Ball offers a 4x catchrate on the first turn. Only use on first turn.
The Timer Ball offers a 4x catchrate after 10 turns.
The Lure Ball offers a 4x catchrate when fishing.
The Repeat Ball offers a 3x catchrate on Pokemon caught before,
which is good for nature/IV hunting.
These are my favorites.
Compare to the 2x catchrate of an Ultra Ball.
