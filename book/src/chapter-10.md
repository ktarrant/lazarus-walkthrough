# Backtracking - New Areas With Surf

Now that we have surf, there are several places we can go back to
to access areas we could not get to before.

## Kalami City
First ask the old sailer to take you to Kalami City.
You can't catch everything here yet, because a couple Pokemon require Super Rod.
I couldn't find anything else here, so move on north to Riverwalk Trail.

## Riverwalk Trail
- If you surf near the empty pier on the east side, you can find a Water Stone.
- You only need the Land Pokemon to finish the area, so it was already completable.
- In the North section, you surf across the river to get a TM40 Aerial Ace.

## Acrisia City
- I don't think there's any surf spots around here.
- All the students in this area and the Mountains are are looking for all Land Pokemon,
so it's not necessary to surf to get the rewards.

## Bronze Fields
- No surfing here either. Keep going South.

## Jusmail Town
- No surfind here either. Keep going South.
