# Backtracking - New Areas With Surf

Now that we have surf, there are several places we can go back to
to access areas we could not get to before.
You can skip this chapter or do it later if you don't feel like it.
But it's a good opportunity to capture more Pokemon, complete more of
your University Student Rewards, and find some nice items.

## Kalami City
First ask the old sailer to take you to Kalami City.
You can't catch everything here yet, because a couple Pokemon require Super Rod.
I couldn't find anything else here, so move on north to Riverwalk Trail.

## Riverwalk Trail
- If you surf near the empty pier on the east side, you can find a Water Stone.
- You only need the Land Pokemon to finish the area, so it was already completable.
- In the North section, you surf across the river to get a TM40 Aerial Ace.

## Acrisia City
- I don't think there's any surf spots around here.
- All the students in this area and the Mountains are are looking for all Land Pokemon,
so it's not necessary to surf to get the rewards.

## Bronze Fields
- No surfing here either. Keep going South.

## Jusmail Town
- No surfing here either. Keep going South.

## Wanderer's Woods
- Surf to the west near the entrance to get a Razor Fang.
- Surf accross another pond in the southeast to get TM23 Hex.
- The University Reward for this area is only for Land pokemon.

## Pythios Town
- You can surf accross a small pond in the north of the cemetary
to get TM30 Shadow Ball.

## Erinys Path
No surfing here either. Keep going east.

## Froslass Cave
- Surf the pond near the little girl to get TM46 Thief.
- Now that we have surf, we can surf north in the same pond to
do the Froslass encounter and complete the quest.
It is level 35.
I got lucky and got it first try with a Quick Ball.
The little girl will want to see the Froslass, so have an empty
slot in your party or you will have to come back.
This Pokemon comes with an Amulet Coin.
This Pokemon is Strong! Will-o-wisp and Infernal Parade are a strong combo.

## Sofos City
- With Surf and the Good Rod, you can catch all Pokemon in Sofos
City to complete the University Student reward.
