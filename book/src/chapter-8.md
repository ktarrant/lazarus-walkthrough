# Sofos City

## Sofos City
- Sofos City is home to the fourth gym. She uses Fighting and Psychic types.
This gym uses a Gauntlet style, where you have to fight all the trainers and the
leader without returning to the PokeCenter.
- The street vendor sells apples to evolve Applin.
- There is an Arcade/Game Corner. You can play pinball to win points
to buy rare items and EV items.
It seems like you can you only get at most 1 pinball point per game played.
Since you can finish the Diglett and Gengar pinballs early, I think they are the
fastest for grinding.
I think the Gengar one may be the easiest, but the Diglett one is the fastest
if you can consistently win.
- A fisherman to the northeast of the city will give you the Good Rod.
- To unlock the gym, you will have to first go north to Satyr's Lair
north of the city to fight Team Chimera. They will give you the
Key Stone to show to Niko. Niko will give you HM03 Surf.

### Battle Pavilion
In the Battle Pavilion you take three rental Pokemon and then fight
three battles with those Pokemon, with an option to swap one after
each fight.
These fights can be a little tricky. I lost a few times.
I think the best strategy is to spam status moves.
I found Dedenne with Nuzzle and
Ralts with the Hypnosis/Dream Eater combo to be particularly effective.
If you win the three fights you will be awarded a Wishing Star.
