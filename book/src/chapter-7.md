# Erinys Path & Froslass Cavern

## The Old Sailor
Before leaving town, talk to the old sailor at the south edge of town once you
beat the Gym. He will ask you to defeat the Chimera Grunt to the east in the
Erinys Path.
Once you beat the grunt, you will be able to sail with Piraeus.
Until you beat more gyms, your only options are Kalami City and Pythios Town.
