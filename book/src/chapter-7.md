# Erinys Path, Froslass Cavern, & Asfal Hills

## The Old Sailor
Before leaving town, talk to the old sailor at the south edge of town once you
beat the Gym. He will ask you to defeat the Chimera Grunt to the east in the
Erinys Path.
Once you beat the grunt, you will be able to sail with Piraeus.
Until you beat more gyms, your only options are Kalami City and Pythios Town.

## Erinys Path
Once you save the sailor you can continue east through Erinys Path.
At the end is Froslass Cavern, with even more trainers, so bring healing
if you can afford it as it is a long way to go back and forth to the
PokeCenter.

Mercifully a nurse will heal your Pokemon once you leave the cave.
