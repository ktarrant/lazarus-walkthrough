# Introduction

Welcome to the Pokémon walkthrough project! This mdBook will eventually hold a
step-by-step guide through the core story beats, optional quests, and team
building strategies for multiple regions. For now we are laying the groundwork
for the guide and documenting useful reference material pulled from the
repository notes.

We also cache the entire PokeAPI dataset locally (see `pokemon-cards.md`) so any
chapter can drop in a fully generated Pokémon card for quick reference on a
species’ abilities, moves, evolutions, and stats without copying values by hand.
