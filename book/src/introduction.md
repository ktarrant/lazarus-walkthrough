# Introduction

Welcome to the Pokémon walkthrough project! This guide focuses on the ROM hack
**Pokémon Lazarus**, beginning in Acrisia City and chronicling the journey to
Jusmail Town and beyond. Expect detailed notes on every mandatory battle,
sidequest, and team-building milestone designed specifically for Lazarus. For
now we are laying the groundwork for the guide and documenting useful reference
material pulled from the repository notes, including the full list of Lazarus
starter options: Popplio, Rowlet, Froakie, Chespin, Litten, Quaxly, Fennekin,
Sprigatito, and Fuecoco.

We also cache the entire PokeAPI dataset locally (see `pokemon-cards.md`) so any
chapter can drop in a fully generated Pokémon card for quick reference on a
species’ abilities, moves, evolutions, and stats without copying values by hand.

Wild encounter information is transcribed from the PDF `Pokemon Lazarus
Documentation - Encounters.pdf` into structured JSON (see `encounters.md`). That
data powers reusable tables so every route reference stays consistent with the
original documentation.
