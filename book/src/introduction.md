# Introduction

Welcome to the Pokémon walkthrough project! This guide focuses on the ROM hack
**Pokémon Lazarus**, beginning in Acrisia City and chronicling the journey to
Jusmail Town and beyond. Expect detailed notes on every mandatory battle,
sidequest, and team-building milestone designed specifically for Lazarus. For
now we are laying the groundwork for the guide and documenting useful reference
material pulled from the repository notes, including the full list of Lazarus
starter options: Popplio, Rowlet, Froakie, Chespin, Litten, Quaxly, Fennekin,
Sprigatito, and Fuecoco.

The walkthrough includes reusable Pokémon cards and encounter tables so future
chapters can focus on story beats, team-building tips, and battle strategies
without repeating raw data.
